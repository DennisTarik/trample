# Project Title

Quickly bootstrap a new project with Vite Boilerplate.

Initially appeared on
[gist](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2). But the page cannot open anymore so that is why I have moved it here.

## Getting Started

This boilerplate contains all the tools you need to build a modern web app with TypeScript, React, Vite, Storybook and Express.  
You can use it to quickly bootstrap your project.

## Ports

The default PORTS are:

- `3001` for the server
- `3000` for the client
- `6006` for the storybook

## Installing

First, [create a repository from this template](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).

Now you are ready to go:

```shell
npm install
```

This will install the dependencies required to run the boilerplate.

```shell
npm run dev
```

Boom! These scripts run your server, client and storybook in development mode.

## Start Developing

To build the project, run:

```shell
npm run build
```

This will build the client, server and storybook.

```shell
npm start
```

## Running the tests

A test runner is not installed (right now). But TypeScript, linter and prettier are checked on commit and push thanks to husky and lintstaged.
